# Chef Playground

### Description
Based on examples from "Learning Chef" by Mischa Taylor and Seth Vargo, this repo contains Chef objects such as nodes, data bags, roles and environments.  They are loaded onto chef-zero running on your host so you can run the `knife` tool, write and test cookbooks in no time.


### Usage
1. Clone this repo
2. Run chef-zero --port 9051
3. Run build.sh to load nodes, data bags, roles and environments
